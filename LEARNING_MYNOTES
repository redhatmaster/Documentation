1. Booting Procedure

STEP-1: Power Supply ---> ac current-----> SMPS(Swithing Mode Power Supply)----> convert to dc current ------> PowerGood Signal

# A timer in the MotherBoard will be sending reset signal to CPU untill PowerGood Signal.

STEP-2: After PowerGood Signal is recieved to the motherboard, resetting is stopped and CPU searches for Instructions in ROM.
# ROM [ FFFF:0000h] only one instruction set which is last region of ROM called JUMP command tells BIOS program Location

STEP-3: BIOS gets 

POST (power on self test) triggered which undergoes Warm Start--------> Intigrety check for h/w components 
                                                                                          [timerICs ,DMA Controler ,CPU,Vedio RAM]
                                                                    and Cold Start------> [Motherboard keyboard printer port Hardrive]


BIOS Check -----> CMOS settings (RAM)
                  -------------------
               Boot Order - OS location to boot 
                    1.CD ROM
                    2.HARD DISK
                    ....
 
 STEP-4: MBR (Master Boot Record) and GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)
 
 BIOS ----> finds ------> MBR in Harddisk [Boot Sector - 1st sector of Hard disk(512MB)] ----> loads contents of MBR ----> RAM
 MBR -----> initialises ---------> GRUB - 1st stage of Boot Loader
 
 # GRUB 1st Stage: Sector 0 : GRUB 1st Stage of boot loader looks for the flag in Partition Table to know which partition has to be searched for KERNAL
                   KERNAL SEARCH: GRUB Loads file system drivers (s/w that manager h/w controllers) inorder to access /boot/grub/grub.conf for Kernal Path.
 # GRUB 2nd Stage : Loads Kernal image and Initrd.
  Loading Kernal Image : Kernal Image is a Compressed file - executable bz image file.Kernal loads temporary file system before
                         loading ROOT file system  with insmod and rmmod commands in initrd image.
                         Kernal is now loaded to memory and executes 1st User space program called /sbin/init whose pid is 1
                         and looks for /etc/initab conf file for default Run level.
